# Mix and Magic

A web based RPG where you assemble a powerful party to fight enemies and clear a final challenge.

## Party Members
Each party member that you joins you will have a class and a type.
Their class determines their stat distribution, and what types of moves they
will learn. `Mage, Fighter, Tank, or Healer`
- <b>Mages</b> are crafty fighters, who deal damage from a distance and can land devastating
secondary effects.  But they are very frail
- <b>Fighters</b> are tough, but reckless brawlers.  They can deal and take big damage,
but will often run into recoil or other dangerous effects
- <b>Tanks</b> aren't as strong as fighters, but they sure can take a hit.  Enemies will have
a hard time going through your tanks.  And they have some support options to help out teammates.
- <b>Healers</b> won't be dealing massive damage or surviving big hits, but they can sure help
out their allies.  Healers can heal or buff allies, de-buff enemies, and apply detrimental
statuses

Each party member will also have a `type`.  This affects what types of status they can use
and which status they are immune to. `Ex: light, dark, fire, water, earth`
- I'm still figuring out how I want these to work.

## Map
The world you will travel consists of several "zones". Each zone contains: a shop, some enemies,
a new party member, and a "zone boss".  In order to progress, you must fight the zone boss.
And they play dirty.

## Mechanics
You can have up to three members in your party at any point in time.  And up to two additional
reserve party members.  You can swap them between battles.<br />
Each party member can hold an item.  These powerful items can be bought from a random selection
at each shop.<br />
Find a powerful combination of allies and items to clear the challenges ahead!
